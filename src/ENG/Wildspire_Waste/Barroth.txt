Assigned Starting Point
If starting the adventure here, the group gains 1 potion.
You get given jobs all the time; that’s the nature of being a monster hunter. This is the first time you’ve been asked to defend ants’ nests though. Turns out the ants round here are being used for some important scientific research; new technology could be unlocked through understanding how ants carry so much weight, they say. The issue is Barroth, smashing its way through every nest in the region, eating the insects before they can be studied. So, here you are. You’ve got a target, and you know the foetid, marsh-ridden region Barroth inhabits.
Get hunting.

Investigation 1 Starting Point
If starting the adventure here, the group gains 2 potions.
You’re heading after a Barroth. Big, nasty brutes, and they’ve been responsible for impeding vital research. So, that’s why you’re on the trail. And you’ve not spent long patrolling the edges of the swamps where it lives when you find a sign one of the creatures has been here. Barroth claws, wedged into stinking mud. There’s been a fight… probably a Barroth duelling with a Jyuratodus. Those two beasts love to rip each other to pieces. But there’s a Barroth nearby. Time to track it down.
Each hunter gains 1 Barroth Claw.

Get straight after the beast.

Investigation 2 Starting Point
If starting the adventure here, the group gains 1 potion.
Ants. Swarming ants. Too many legs, too many sharp mandibles… too many ants. And you’re having to head into the midst of them to stop a Barroth from eating them. No one ever said being a hunter was a normal way to make a living. But researchers need the ants alive, and not swallowed up by the rampaging Barroth. So here you are, hunkering down amidst a horde of surviving ants and working out where the creature gorging itself on them goes next… 

Bait a trap, luring Barroth back towards you.
Gain and reveal 1 track token, then choose whether to keep or discard it.

Investigation 3 Starting Point
If starting the adventure here, the group gains 2 potions.
Another demolished ant’s nest. That’s what you’re confronted by. Again. It’s been a day of traipsing through bug-infested swampland, your eyes stinging from the noxious gases oozing out of the foetid bog all around you. And for what? So some researchers can find an unharmed ant nest. You’re on the hunt for a Barroth; might as well get to it.

Follow a path of twisted roots, and broken branches.

Investigation 4 Starting Point
If starting the adventure here, the group gains 1 potion.
Researchers say that a Barroth is attacking everything in the nearby swamp. They’re trying to get hold of a series of sample ants, to start building some new technology, and they’ve been unable to. Barroth has ruined every venture they’ve made into the swamp. Smashing encampments to pieces, fighting any other creature that crosses its path. As soon as you enter the swamp, you can see what they mean. There are bones everywhere. Time to hunt.

Study Barroth’s movements. Something is driving it on. Might be able to find out what.
Discard 1 time card. Gain 2 track tokens.
Progress to entry 19.

There are rich pickings for those prepared to spend some time looking…

You race along after Barroth. It hasn’t tried to conceal its tracks at all, simply forced its way through the environment as brutally, and efficiently, as it can. Its path is easy to see, and to follow… but that doesn’t mean it’s safe. Do you try and follow the same path as the creature, or hold back, taking your time?

Hurry! Every second counts!
Discard 2 time cards. Each hunter suffers 1 damage, then gains 1 Barroth Ridge.

Be wary, no point in risking anything yet.
Discard 1 time card.

You curse. Not footprints. The mud here is different to that elsewhere in the swamp, and, with the light distorting your vision, it was an easy mistake. Still, the mud should be useful in itself, and you’ve time to rest now.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Fertile Mud, then add 1 potion to the pool.
Progress to entry 21.

8
A discarded hunter’s pack lies open. You wait a while, to see if anyone returns, but whoever it belonged to is long gone. There’s something glinting beneath the fabric, though. Might be worth investigating.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Carbalite ore, and 1 Machalite ore.

Investigate the mysterious cloud to the east.

Two Barroth? There are two Barroth now? The swamp here is a berserk array of uprooted plant life, trampled animals, and smashed pieces of Barroth. Two Barroth fought it out over this territory, and you’ve no idea which came off better. So, now there are likely two furious hulking monsters rampaging through the swamp. Be careful.

There should be an ant colony nearby. Next step might be to visit there.
Discard 2 time cards. Each hunter gains 1 Barroth Shell. If the group has at least 1 Barroth Ridge, each hunter also gains 1 Barroth Ridge.
Progress to entry 12.
or
What are those noises, just over there?
Progress to entry 14.

The journey through the swamp is tiring, the mud sucks at your feet, making each step a labour. But you’re certain you’re gaining on the beast. The stickiness of the marsh means any tracks are swiftly consumed, but you know Barroth is nearby. You can feel it.

Roll a die.

On a 3-4 add 1 Potion to the pool. Progress to entry 6.
On a 5-6 each hunter gains 1 Fertile Mud. Progress to entry 15.

There’s no sign the creature intends to return to the area, but you find more of its spore. It was a brutal fight, by the looks of thing. Remnants of it are everywhere. But the beast isn’t returning.

Collect the relics of the battle.
Discard 2 time cards. Each hunter gains 1 Monster Bone large and 1 Barroth Shell.
Progress to entry 27.

Make up for lost time!
Progress to entry 6.

The area around the ant colony is a mass of disrupted, uprooted earth. Almost as though Barroth was less a beast than a plough. You’re uncertain what move to make next. You could conduct a more thorough search of the nest – there might be something in there a researcher would pay handsomely for. Or you could rest up. The area is open, and anything that might attack you was probably scared off by Barroth. Or you can keep up the hunt. What’s your next move?

You swear you can hear something, just beyond that hill. Keep going.
Shuffle the Rushed Advance card into the time deck.
Progress to entry 30.

Rest. You’re going to need it, tomorrow.
Discard 2 time cards, all hunters heal to full.

Digging in the ant colony, ruined though it may be, was a good idea.

More evidence of Barroth’s presence. The ground is a ragged mass where the beast’s enormous brow has gouged up a glittering spray of ore…

Roll a die.
Ona 1-4 ignore the ore! Progress to entry 29.
On a 5-6 I mean… it’s just there… Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Carbalite ore, and 1 Machalite ore. Progress to entry 28.

14
The strange noises turn out to be a group of Palico, gambolling in a circle, and entirely unconcerned by the potential presence of a Barroth in the area. Felynes are fast enough to disappear into the swamp should they encounter a threat. The Palicoes notice you, and a few approach, looking up with their big eyes, noses twitching…
Discard 2 time cards.

Ask the Palicoes to accompany you on your hunt.
Each hunter that does not have a Palico draws a Palico card. They may use it during the next hunting phase, then it is discarded.
Progress to entry 15.

They look happy where they are, but they may have information…
Gain and reveal 4 track tokens, then choose whether to keep or discard each token.
Progress to entry 21.

Skirting the most dangerous elements of the swamp proves an effective tactic. And you’re still on the track of Barroth. The scent of freshly turned earth is rich in your nostrils, and it’s dug up more than simply wet mud. The remnants of a long dead beast are scattered across the earth, exposed to the dying sun for the first time in centuries.

Stop to collect what you can.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Ancient Bone.
Progress to entry 22.

(The group may only choose this option if they have at least one Fertile Mud in their inventories)
Offer the creature a silent prayer.

Footprints. Large footprints, set deep into the mud. Only Barroth are big enough to leave track like this. You know you’re gaining on your prey…

Keep up the pursuit. It’s only a matter of time.
Discard 1 time card. Gain 2 track tokens.
Progress to entry 30.
or
Explore this area more closely. The Barroth has been here. There may be further clues.
Discard 1 time card. Reveal up to three tokens from the pool.
Progress to entry 29.

Creatures get sucked into the marsh land around here all the time. One step too deep, the quicksand seizes them…and this is the result. This beast died a few weeks ago. The carcass is picked clean, only a few strands of mummified flesh cling to the skeleton of the beast, like ragged banners above a slaughtered army. But there’s no time to dwell on such things. Your hunt needs to continue.
Each hunter gains 1 Monster Bone medium.

Press on.
Discard 1 time card. Gain 1 track token. Shuffle the Barroth Slayer card into the time deck.
Progress to entry 8.
or
Stay and root through the carcass.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Quality Bone and 1 Monster Bone small.
Progress to entry 8.

So, this is what happens to a lesser Barroth. The creature lies at the edge of the swamp, it’s flanks opened, scored with a terrible wound. Ruined ribs poke upwards and out from lacerated flesh. It fought well. The great ridge above its eyes is buckled from where it has been driven, relentlessly, into the foe. But to no avail.
Each hunter gains 1 Barroth Ridge.

There is a glinting patch of mud… perhaps what drew the creature here to die.
Discard 1 time card. Gain 1 Fertile Mud.
Progress to entry 22.
or
One fewer Barroth to worry about.
Progress to entry 7.

A trader, panicked but still willing to sell you something, is hurrying from the swamp.
The group may discard any 3 resources, and either add 1 Potion to the pool or gain 1 track token. Discard 1 time card.
Progress to entry 13.

20
Building the trap takes some time. Then you wait. And wait. And wait. Nothing. Barroth is either significantly smarter than you’d first assumed, or it’s found other ants to feast on. So what are you doing now?

Abandon the trap, head into the swamp.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Monster Keenbone.
Progress to entry 15.
or
Are those Barroth footprints?
Discard 1 time card. Gain 2 track tokens.
Progress to entry 7.
or
(The group may only choose this option if they have at least one Barroth Shell in their inventories)
You’re certain you recognize more remnants of Barroth’s path ahead. Worth pursuing, for sure.
Progress to entry 18.

21
You awake feeling refreshed. You might not have made much progress in the hunt, but at least you’ll be in decent shape when you encounter Barroth. You begin stalking the beast again, exploring deeper into the swamp. Barroths aren’t subtle creatures, and it isn’t long before you’re convinced you’re on its tail…

You’re approaching the beast.
If the group has four or less track tokens, gain 1 track token.
Progress to entry 30.

22
It’s been a bad start. Your arms and face sting from the bites, and you’ve barely seen anything to hint Barroth hunts these marshes at all. Until now. A collection of the hardy trees growing in the swamp have been torn up and flung apart by something big, and heavy. The marks on the trunks look like they were made by Barroth plates…

Pursue this lead!
Discard 1 time card. Gain 3 track tokens.
Progress to entry 29.
or
Hunker down and wait. The beast might still be in the area.
Progress to entry 30.

23
Hornets! Hornets! Or, at least, something that looks a lot like hornets and stings a lot like them too. A cloud of the foul things surrounds you, jabbing and swooping, as you try to fight them off!

Flee from the hideous swarm!
All hunters suffer 2 damage. Progress to entry 22.

Fight them off!

More evidence of the savagery of Barroth you’re chasing. Another of its kin, trampled and bludgeoned to death. It took you a few minutes to determine it was a Barroth you were looking at, so comprehensive is the damage.
Each hunter gains 1 Barroth Carapace.

Progress to entry 19.

The remains of a Kestodon, clearly taken down by a Barroth. Those researchers were right… this monster is very, very, angry. And even more dangerous. It’s dealt with this Kestodon brutally.

The beast has been here, rooting through more smashed ant’s nests. The broken carapaces of insects are scattered across the clearing, and the signs of Barroth’s feeding frenzy are difficult to miss. It doesn’t have much in the way of table manners.

Stop to investigate Barroth’s feeding habits.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter gains 1 Barroth Carapace and 1 Monster Hardbone.
Progress to entry 11.

You’re sure the beast is still in the vicinity. Explore the area carefully.

Another hunter’s pack. Or perhaps this belonged to a researcher. It’s difficult to tell. Something happened to a group of people exploring this area, that’s certain. Their belongings are scattered about this place, most of them smashed or ruined. An encampment broken to pieces by a charging Barroth. Worth examining the wreckage, perhaps… or get straight on the creature’s path.

Examine the debris.
Discard 1 time card. Each hunter rolls on the following table.
On a 1-2 gain 1 Dragonite ore

No time for that. Keep hunting.
Progress to entry 30.

A smashed ant nest confronts you as you chase Barroth. The colony lies open, its inhabitants either eaten or crushed under huge, charging feet. No wonder the researchers want the beast dealt with. It leaves little behind to give you a clue as to its next move, now it’s fed. Time to make a choice.

Those might be footprints…
Discard 1 time card. Gain 1 track token.

Spend a little more time with the nest.
Discard 1 track token.

Your instincts are good. Only a few minutes later, you hear the odd trumpeting cry of Barroth, the grunting and smashing as it hurls aside great clumps of sodden earth in search of food. It’s nearly upon you. Brace yourselves for the fight.
Reveal your track tokens, check the Scoutfly level, and begin the hunting phase.
